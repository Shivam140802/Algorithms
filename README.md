# Classical Synchronization Problems

This repository contains implementations of classic synchronization problems in operating systems using multithreading and semaphores. These problems help understand how processes/threads can safely share resources in concurrent programming.

## 🧩 Problems Covered

1. **Dining Philosophers Problem**
2. **Producer-Consumer Problem**
3. **Readers-Writers Problem**

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- C 
- POSIX Threads
- Semaphores
- Mutex Locks

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Example for a C program
gcc dino_philo.c - -o dino_philo

./dino_philo
